# HR-Attrition
I analysed and built a dashboard with Power BI in this HR Attrition project during my internship at MeriSKILL.

During my internship at MeriSKILL, I embarked on an exciting project, this time focusing on HR Analytics and the creation of an "HR Attrition Dashboard." 📈💼

🔍 Exploring HR Dataset:

📉 Data Cleaning:
- I kicked off this project by cleaning and preparing the data. This involved deleting redundant columns, renaming columns for clarity, dropping duplicates, and cleaning individual columns to ensure data integrity.
- Removing NaN values was a critical step in maintaining the quality of the dataset.

📊 Data Visualization:
- To provide a comprehensive view, I created visualizations for various factors that impact attrition:
 - Overtime: Examining the influence of overtime work on attrition.
 - Marital Status: Assessing how marital status affects attrition rates.
 - Job Role: Identifying which job roles are more prone to attrition.
 - Gender: Analyzing the gender-based differences in attrition.
 - Department: Exploring attrition rates in R&D, Sales, and Human Resource departments.
 - Business Travel: Investigating attrition concerning different travel frequencies.
 - Total Working Years: Evaluating how work experience influences attrition.

📈 Key Insights Generated:
- The dataset includes 1,470 employees with an average age of 36.92.
- The average monthly income stands at 6,500.
- There are three distinct departments: R&D, Sales, and Human Resource.
- A total of nine unique job roles are observed within the company.
- The overall attrition rate is 16.12%, indicating the importance of this analysis in employee retention strategies.
- Interestingly, the data suggests that more men resign than women.
- Additionally, it appears that single individuals tend to resign more frequently than their married or divorced counterparts.
- Employees who travel frequently exhibit a higher attrition rate, emphasizing the need for travel-related policy improvements.
- Sales representatives experience the highest attrition rate among various job roles.
- The Sales department is particularly susceptible to attrition, highlighting the potential need for focused retention strategies within this department.

🌟 Recommendations:
1. The company should improve the motivation of Sales Reps in order to reduce their attrition.
2. The company should consider travels of employees and resolve any related issues that may arise leading to attritions.
3. The company should investigate as to why single employees resign much more than those married.
4. In general, the company should put in place measures to reduce employee attrition.
